# Birth React

#### Traditionally

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

This resulted in compatibility problems between different browsers.
JQuery solved most compatibility problems, but resulted in full applications with large files.
Backbone.js library allowed us to organize this large files in manageable chunks.
These innovations resulted in the birth of the Single Page Application (SPA).

In 2010 Angular js was released with better containers, models, views and controllers.
Resulted in more and more complexity and bugs.

In 2013 React was released trying to fix these problems.

#### React Concepts

- Don't touch the DOM, I will do it for you.    Declarative not Imperative
- Build websites like Lego blocks               Components
- One directional data flow                     State change -> Virtual DOM -> Change component
- Only the UI, the rest is up to you            Only the View, Modular
